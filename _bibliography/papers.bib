While previous studies have examined code search on the basis of code-level, fine-grained specifications such as functionality, logic, or implementation, CHICOT addresses a unique mission: code search with high-level contextual information, such as the purpose or domain of a developer’s project.
It achieves this feature by first extracting the context information from codebases and then considering this context during the search.
It provides a VSCode plugin for daily coding assistance, and the built-in crawler ensures up-to-date code suggestions.
The case study attests to the utility of CHICOT in real-world scenarios.}, number={21}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Morishita, Terufumi and Koreeda, Yuta and Yamaguchi, Atsuki and Morio, Gaku and Imaichi, Osamu and Sogawa, Yasuhiro}, year={2024}, month={Mar.}, pages={23817-23819} }

    abstract = "Masked language modeling (MLM) is a widely used self-supervised pretraining objective, where a model needs to predict an original token that is replaced with a mask given contexts. Although simpler and computationally efficient pretraining objectives, e.g., predicting the first character of a masked token, have recently shown comparable results to MLM, no objectives with a masking scheme actually outperform it in downstream tasks. Motivated by the assumption that their lack of complexity plays a vital role in the degradation, we validate whether more complex masked objectives can achieve better results and investigate how much complexity they should have to perform comparably to MLM. Our results using GLUE, SQuAD, and Universal Dependencies benchmarks demonstrate that more complicated objectives tend to show better downstream results with at least half of the MLM complexity needed to perform comparably to MLM. Finally, we discuss how we should pretrain a model using a masked objective from the task complexity perspective."

Due to the unsupervised nature of the task, we concentrated on inquiring about the similarity measures induced by different layers of different pre-trained Transformer-based language models, which can be good approximations of the human sense of word similarity. Interestingly, our experiments reveal a language-independent characteristic: the middle to upper layers of Transformer-based language models can induce good approximate similarity measures. Finally, our system was ranked 1st on the Slovenian part of Subtask1 and 2nd on the Croatian part of both Subtask1 and Subtask2."
