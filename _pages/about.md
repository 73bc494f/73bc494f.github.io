Gaku Morio is a researcher at the intersection of NLP, social, and sustainability, currently serving as a Visiting Scholar at Stanford University under the guidance of [Prof. Christopher D. Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/) and a researcher at [Hitachi](https://www.hitachi.com/). My academic journey began with a BEng and MEng from the [Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology](https://www.tuat.ac.jp/en/), where I received top honors and the best research award. At Hitachi, I have since developed a career in NLP especially in argument mining and parsing, contributing to fundamental research, real-world applications, and interdisciplinary collaborations. I always bridged the gap between advanced NLP techniques and industrial applications for finance, maitenance, and public service.

My recent research focus lies in investigating corporate sustainability claims and addressing the challenges of "greenwashing". My recent work at Stanford has resulted in contributions to analyzing corporate climate stances and sustainability reporting. I have published in leading conferences such as NeurIPS, ACL, and IJCAI and have collaborated with global experts in climate policy, sustainable finance, and AI. In addition to research, I have actively contributed to fostering academic exchange. I was a keynote speaker at [ClimateNLP](https://nlp4climate.github.io/climatenlp2024/) of ACL 2024. I am a organizing member of some workshops such as [Sustainable Transition with AI](https://stai.jeju.ai/) at IJCAI 2024 and [ClimateNLP 2025](https://nlp4climate.github.io/) at ACL 2025.

Driven by a commitment to meaningful impact, my long-term vision is to harness AI to provide actionable insights for stakeholders. It will enable evidence-based decision-making to promote better society (not limited to climate change).
